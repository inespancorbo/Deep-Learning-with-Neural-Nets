# SemEval 2019
## International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 

Worked on Task 6: **Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Media**

[See the available Tasks](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2019/index.php?id=tasks)

[See a summary of the results for all participating groups in Task 6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08983.pdf)

Approached the task using two neural network models:

(1) GRU

(2) BERT

[See working paper with model results](https://github.com/inespancorbo/Deep-Learning-with-Neural-Nets/blob/master/Projects/SemEval-2019/SemEval-2019-Paper.pdf)

If interested in seeing the code employed, uploaded are two easy to read Jupyter notebooks:

(1) [See GRU jupyter notebook](https://github.com/inespancorbo/Deep-Learning-with-Neural-Nets/blob/master/Projects/SemEval-2019/RNN_notebook.ipynb)
(2) [See BERT jupyter notebook](https://github.com/inespancorbo/Deep-Learning-with-Neural-Nets/blob/master/Projects/SemEval-2019/BERT_notebook.ipynb)
