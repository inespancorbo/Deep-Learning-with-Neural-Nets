# Character Language Model üìù

The main goal of any language model is to learn the joint probability distribution of sequences of characters/words in a training text, i.e. trying to learn the joint probability function.

The uploaded code is a character language model and so it intends to predict the next character given all previous characters in a sequence of data.

Training data used was in English. An RNN was employed.

However, feel free to use a different language, while keeping in mind some modification to the code will be necessary.
